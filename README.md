### Main questions of the Thesis:
1. Do human and mouse neurons exhibit statistically significant differences in their topological structure? 
    *We seek to validate the findings in the recent paper using persistent homology and functional summaries.*

2. Can persistent homology and its functional summaries effectively capture meaningful morphological variability across species? 
    *Are topological descriptors (like persistence landscapes and silhouettes) are informative and discriminative in a neuroscientific context?*

3. Are the observed differences in topological descriptors robust to sampling variability and noise? 
    *we test this using statistical tools such as confidence bands and permutation tests, especially given the imbalance in sample sizes between humans and mice.*

4. Which functional summary (entropy, landscape, silhouette) provides the most stable and interpretable representation for comparing neuron populations? 
    *While all are tested, this question evaluates their comparative usefulness for statistical inference.*




### Oral presentation

**Tips**

- Give some general context
- could do a whole point on what is persistent diagram, how it works, how we get the silhouette, etc (explain what is the object we work with, also needed definition and/or thm, etc)
- have some graphs to explain the definition over
- have some example where my results could be used (either examples to motivate the project at the beginning, or applications we could use it for at the end) (could for example speak about classification of different type of cell)


**To look into**
- Persistent cohomology enriches point clouds (that are poorly topological)
- The more far a point is from the diagonal, the longer it lives (persistent diagram)

**For the report**
- Have a general introduction on TDA and Homology
- Could also try other functional summaries than persistent silhouette (and maybe justify why one is better than the other) (landscape and entropy)
- Could see which part of the neurons gives the best results for the permutation tests
- permutation test inside the groups itself
